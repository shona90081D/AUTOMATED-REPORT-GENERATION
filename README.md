## TASK DESCRIPTION

Automated Report Generation Objective: The primary goal of this task is to develop an automated report generation system using Python. The script reads structured data from a file (such as a CSV), performs data analysis, and generates a well-formatted and presentable PDF report. This task emphasizes practical skills in file handling, data processing, and PDF document creation using libraries such as FPDF or ReportLab.

Implementation: The solution involves three main stages:

Data Reading The script starts by reading data from a CSV file that contains student names, subjects, and their corresponding marks. The CSV format is used due to its simplicity and compatibility with spreadsheet tools. Python’s built-in csv module is utilized for efficient parsing of the data.

Data Analysis Once the data is loaded, the script performs basic statistical analysis:

Calculates the total number of students

Sums up the total marks

Computes the average marks

These statistics offer a high-level overview of the academic performance in the dataset and are useful for educators or analysts who need a quick summary.

PDF Report Generation Using the FPDF library, a formatted PDF report is generated. The PDF includes:
A stylized title header

A summary section highlighting the total students, total marks, and average marks

A data table that lists each student’s name, subject, and marks

A footer with the page number

Design enhancements such as colored table headers, background fill, and font styling are added to make the report visually appealing and easy to read.

Applications: This automated report generation system has a wide range of real-world applications:

Education Sector Teachers can use it to automatically generate performance reports of students. Educational institutions can summarize results of exams or tests efficiently. Helps standardize report formats across multiple departments.

Corporate Training HR departments can track employee training scores and generate automated performance summaries. Used in internal assessments and skill development programs.

Data Analysis and Reporting Can be adapted for any data summary task (e.g., sales reports, inventory summaries). Saves time and reduces manual effort in generating recurring reports.

This task demonstrates how Python can be used not only for data analysis but also for generating professional documents automatically. By integrating data handling, computation, and report generation, the script is a compact yet powerful tool for turning raw data into actionable reports—applicable in educational, corporate, and analytical settings.
